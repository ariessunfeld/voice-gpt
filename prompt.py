"""This file contains the header prompts that get sent to GPT with each exchange.
By default, they are designed to steer GPT towards concise and accurate answers.
However, you may modify them as suits your need.

To avoid issues with overuse of the model, do not include many messages here. 
By default, thre are only three. You do not need three; you can get away with only
including the very first "system" message. The subsequent example messages are just
there for further alignment.
